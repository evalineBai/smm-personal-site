      My goal is understanding exoplanet dynamics and evolution through computational modeling.

      I'm a post-doctoral researcher at The California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, CA. I did my PhD in Astrophysics at The University of Chicago, advised by Professor Dan Fabrycky, and Bachelor's in Physics and English from Caltech.
