      Hello, I'm Sean. My goal is to apply scientific rigor to financial ML models and portfolio management.
      <br />
      <br />
      Prior to becoming a machine learning credit modeling researcher, 
      I was a post-doctoral scholar 
      at The California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, CA. I did my PhD in computational Astrophysics
      at The University of Chicago, advised by Professor Dan Fabrycky, and Bachelor's in
      Physics and English from Caltech.
      <br />
      <br />
      Outside of work, you may find me playing ultimate frisbee, traveling,
      or exploring restaurants in San Francisco with my fianc√©e.
